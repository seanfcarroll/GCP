![Google Cloud Self-Paced Labs](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/GMOHykaqmlTHiqEeQXTySaMXYPHeIvaqa2qHEzw6Occ%3D)

## Overview

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides networking functionality to Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances, Kubernetes Engine containers and App Engine Flex. In other words, without a VPC network you cannot create VM instances, containers or App Engine applications. Therefore, each GCP project has a **default** network to get you started.

You can think of a VPC network the same way you would think of a physical network, except that it is virtualized within GCP. A VPC network is a global resource which consists of a list of regional virtual subnetworks (subnets) in data centers, all connected by a global wide area network (WAN). VPC networks are logically isolated from each other in GCP.

In this lab, you create an auto mode VPC network with firewall rules and two VM instances. Then, you explore the connectivity for the VM instances.

### Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Explore the default VPC network
- Create an auto mode network with firewall rules
- Create VM instances using Compute Engine
- Explore the connectivity for VM instances

## Setup and Requirements

#### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This Qwiklabs hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access the Google Cloud Platform for the duration of the lab.

#### What you need

To complete this lab, you need:

- Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
- Time to complete the lab.
  **_Note:_** If you already have your own personal GCP account or project, do not use it for this lab.

#### How to start your lab and sign in to the Console

1.  Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is a panel populated with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.
    ![Open Google Console](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/%2FtHp4GI5VSDyTtdqi3qDFtevuY014F88%2BFow%2FadnRgE%3D)
2.  Copy the username, and then click **Open Google Console**. The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the **Choose an account** page.
    **_Tip:_** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
3.  On the Choose an account page, click **Use Another Account**.
    ![Choose an account](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/eQ6xPnPn13GjiJP3RWlHWwiMjhooHxTNvzfg1AL2WPw%3D)
4.  The Sign in page opens. Paste the username that you copied from the Connection Details panel. Then copy and paste the password.
    **_Important:_** You must use the credentials from the Connection Details panel. Do not use your Qwiklabs credentials. If you have your own GCP account, do not use it for this lab (avoids incurring charges).
5.  Click through the subsequent pages:
    - Accept the terms and conditions.
    - Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
    - Do not sign up for free trials.

After a few moments, the GCP console opens in this tab.
**Note:** You can view the menu with a list of GCP Products and Services by clicking the **Navigation menu** at the top-left, next to “Google Cloud Platform”. ![Cloud Console Menu](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/9vT7xPlxoNP%2FPsK0J8j0ZPFB4HnnpaIJVCDByaBrSHg%3D)

## Explore the default network

Each GCP project has a **default** network with subnets, routes, and firewall rules.

### **View the subnets**

The **default** network has a subnet in [each GCP region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/#available).

In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **VPC network** > **VPC networks**.
![nav_vpc_network.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/hAQgo2bkZnFaWazL1JSbsDwGi5GQulq38scuxHKH6to%3D)

Notice the **default** network with its subnets.

Each subnet is associated with a GCP region and a private RFC 1918 CIDR block for its internal **IP addresses range** and a **gateway**.

### **View the routes**

Routes tell VM instances and the VPC network how to send traffic from an instance to a destination, either inside the network or outside of GCP. Each VPC network comes with some default routes to route traffic among its subnets and send traffic from eligible instances to the Internet.

In the left pane, click on **Routes**.
![routes.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/ctqghMWPvAaORt%2Bfu6IdCJv9wii%2Fag2aPVQNmC%2B%2BSRo%3D)

Notice that there is a route for each subnet and one for the **Default internet gateway** (0.0.0.0./0).

These routes are managed for you but you can create custom static routes to direct some packets to specific destinations. For example, you can create a route that sends all outbound traffic to an instance configured as a NAT gateway.

### **View the firewall rules**

Each VPC network implements a distributed virtual firewall that you can configure. Firewall rules allow you to control which packets are allowed to travel to which destinations. Every VPC network has two implied firewall rules that block all incoming connections and allow all outgoing connections.

In the left pane, click on **Firewall rules**.

Notice that there are 4 **Ingress** firewall rules for the **default** network:

- default-allow-icmp
- default-allow-internal
- default-allow-rdp
- default-allow-ssh

These firewall rules allow **ICMP**, **RDP** and **SSH** ingress traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) and all **TCP**, **UDP** and **ICMP** traffic within the network (10.128.0.0/9). The **Targets**, **Source filters**, **Protocols/ports** and **Action** columns explain these rules.

### **Delete the default network**

1.  In the left pane, click on **Firewall rules**.
2.  Select all firewall rules and click **DELETE**.
3.  In the left pane, click on **VPC networks**.
4.  Click on the **default** network.
5.  Click **Delete VPC network** at the top of the dialog, then click **Delete** to confirm the deletion of the **default** network.
    Wait for the network to be deleted before moving on.
6.  In the left pane, click on **Routes**.
    Notice that there are no routes.

Without a VPC network, there are no routes!

### **Try to create a VM instance**

Verify that you cannot create a VM instance without a VPC network.

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**, and then click **Create** to create a VM instance.
2.  Leave all the values at their default and click **Create**.
    Notice the error.
3.  Under the **Firewall** section, Click **Management, disks, networking, SSH keys**, and then click **Networking**.
    ![networking.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/ejEcf44Xu%2B1i2NWwdmTCsJuakdMFgDB13xacs2G9yig%3D)
4.  Notice the **No local network available** error under **Network interface**.
5.  Click **Cancel**.

As expected, you cannot create a VM instance without a VPC network!

## Create a VPC network and VM instances

Create a VPC network so that you can create VM instances.

### **Create an auto mode VPC network with Firewall rules**

Replicate the **default** network by creating an auto mode network.

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **VPC network** > **VPC networks**, and then click **Create VPC network**.
2.  Set the **Name** to `mynetwork`.
3.  For **Subnet creation mode**, click **Automatic**.
    Auto mode networks create subnets in each region automatically.
4.  For **Firewall rules**, check all available rules.
    These are the same standard firewall rules that the default network had.

The **deny-all-ingress** and **allow-all-egress** rules are also displayed, but you cannot check or uncheck them as they are implied. These two rules have a lower **Priority** (higher integers indicate lower priorities) so that the allow ICMP, internal, RDP and SSH rules are considered first.

5.  Click **Create**, then wait for **mynetwork** to be created.
    Notice that a subnet was created for each region.
6.  Record the IP address range for the subnets in **us-central1** and **europe-west1**. You will refer to these in the next steps.

If you ever delete the default network, you can quickly re-create it by creating an auto mode network as you just did.

### Test Completed Task

Click **Check my progress** to verify your performed task. If you have completed the task successfully you will granted with an assessment score.

### **Create a VM instance in us-central1**

Create a VM instance in the us-central1 region. Selecting a region and zone determines the subnet and assigns the internal IP address from the subnet's IP address range.

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**, and then click **Create**.
2.  Set the following values, leaving all others at their defaults:
    Property
    Value (type value or select option as specified)
    Name
    mynet-us-vm
    Region
    us-central1
    Zone
    us-central1-c
    Machine type
    micro (1 shared vCPU)
3.  Click **Create**, then wait for the instance to be created.
4.  Verify that the **Internal IP** was assigned from the IP address range for the subnet in **us-central1** (10.128.0.0/20).
    The **Internal IP** should be 10.128.0.2 as 10.128.0.1 is reserved for the gateway and you have not configured any other instances in that subnet.

### Test Completed Task

Click **Check my progress** to verify your performed task. If you have completed the task successfully you will granted with an assessment score.

### **Create a VM instance in europe-west1**

Create a VM instance in the europe-west1 region.

1.  Click **Create instance**.
2.  Set the following values, leaving all others at their defaults:
    Property
    Value (type value or select option as specified)
    Name
    mynet-eu-vm
    Region
    europe-west1
    Zone
    europe-west1-c
    Machine type
    micro (1 shared vCPU)
3.  Click **Create**, then wait for the instance to be created.
4.  Verify that the **Internal IP** was assigned from the IP address range for the subnet in **europe-west1** (10.132.0.0/20).
    The **Internal IP** should be 10.132.0.2 as 10.132.0.1 is reserved for the gateway and you have not configured any other instances in that subnet.

The **External IP addresses** for both VM instances are ephemeral. If an instance is stopped, any ephemeral external IP addresses assigned to the instance are released back into the general Compute Engine pool and become available for use by other projects. When a stopped instance is started again, a new ephemeral external IP address is assigned to the instance. Alternatively, you can reserve a static external IP address, which assigns the address to your project indefinitely until you explicitly release it.

### Test Completed Task

Click **Check my progress** to verify your performed task. If you have completed the task successfully you will granted with an assessment score.

## Explore the connectivity for VM instances

Explore the connectivity for the VM instances. Specifically, SSH to your VM instances using tcp:22 and ping both the internal and external IP addresses of your VM instances using ICMP. Then, explore the effects of the firewall rules on connectivity by removing the firewall rules one-by-one.

### **Verify connectivity for the VM instances**

The firewall rules that you created with **mynetwork** allow ingress SSH and ICMP traffic from within **mynetwork** (internal IP) and outside of that network (external IP).

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
    Note the external and internal IP addresses for **mynet-eu-vm**.
2.  For **mynet-us-vm**, click **SSH** to launch a terminal and connect. You may have to click **SSH** twice.
    You are able to SSH because of the **allow-ssh** firewall rule, which allows incoming traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) for **tcp:22**.
    The SSH connection works seamlessly because Compute Engine generates an SSH key for you and stores it in one of the following locations: _ By default, Compute Engine adds the generated key to project or instance metadata. _ If your account is configured to use OS Login, Compute Engine stores the generated key with your user account. Alternatively, you can control access to Linux instances by creating SSH keys and editing public SSH key metadata.
3.  To test connectivity to **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP, run the following command using **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP:
    ```
    ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's internal IP here>
    ```
    You are able to ping **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP because of the **allow-internal** firewall rule.
4.  Repeat the same test, this time using **mynet-eu-vm**'s name:
    ```
    ping -c 3 mynet-eu-vm
    ```
    You are able to ping **mynet-eu-vm** by its name because VPC networks have an internal DNS service that allows you to address instances by their DNS names rather than their internal IP addresses. This is very useful as the internal IP address can change when deleting and re-creating an instance.
5.  To test connectivity to **mynet-eu-vm**'s external IP, run the following command using **mynet-eu-vm**'s external IP:
    ```
    ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's external IP here>
    ```

## Test your Understanding

Below are a multiple choice questions to reinforce your understanding of this lab's concepts. Answer them to the best of your abilities.

You were able to SSH to **mynet-us-vm** and ping **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal and external IP address as expected. Alternatively, you could SSH to **mynet-eu-vm** and ping **mynet-us-vm**'s internal and external IP address, which also works.

### **Remove the allow-icmp firewall rules**

Remove the **allow-icmp** firewall rule and try to ping the internal and external IP address of **mynet-eu-vm**.

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **VPC network** > **Firewall rules**.
2.  Check the **mynetwork-allow-icmp** rule.
3.  Click **Delete**, then click **Delete** to confirm the deletion.
    Wait for the firewall rule to be deleted.
4.  Return to the **mynet-us-vm** SSH terminal.
5.  To test connectivity to **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP, run the following command using **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's internal IP here>
```

You are able to ping **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP because of the **allow-internal** firewall rule.

6.  To test connectivity to **mynet-eu-vm**'s external IP, run the following command using **mynet-eu-vm**'s external IP:
    ```
    ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's external IP here>
    ```

The **100% packet loss** indicates that you are unable to ping **mynet-eu-vm**'s external IP. This is expected because you deleted the **allow-icmp** firewall rule!

### **Remove the allow-internal firewall rules**

Remove the **allow-internal** firewall rule and try to ping the internal IP address of **mynet-eu-vm**.

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **VPC network** > **Firewall rules**.
2.  Check the **mynetwork-allow-internal** rule and then click **Delete**. Click **Delete** to confirm the deletion.
    Wait for the firewall rule to be deleted.
3.  Return to the **mynet-us-vm** SSH terminal.
4.  To test connectivity to **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP, run the following command using **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP:
    ```
    ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's internal IP here>
    ```

The **100% packet loss** indicates that you are unable to ping **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP. This is expected because you deleted the **allow-internal** firewall rule!

5.  Close the SSH terminal:
    ```
    exit
    ```

### **Remove the allow-ssh firewall rules**

Remove the **allow-ssh** firewall rule and try to SSH to **mynet-us-vm**.

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **VPC network** > **Firewall rules**.
2.  Check the **mynetwork-allow-ssh** rule and then click **Delete**. Click **Delete** to confirm the deletion.
    Wait for the firewall rule to be deleted.
3.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
4.  For **mynet-us-vm**, click **SSH** to launch a terminal and connect.

The **Connection failed** message indicates that you are unable to SSH to **mynet-us-vm** because you deleted the **allow-ssh** firewall rule!

## Congratulations!

In this lab, you explored the default network along with its subnets, routes, and firewall rules. You deleted the default network and determined that you cannot create any VM instances without a VPC network. Thus, you created a new auto mode VPC network with subnets, routes, firewall rules and two VM instances. Then, you tested the connectivity for the VM instances and explored the effects of the firewall rules on connectivity.
