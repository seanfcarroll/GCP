![Google Cloud Self-Paced Labs](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/GMOHykaqmlTHiqEeQXTySaMXYPHeIvaqa2qHEzw6Occ%3D)

## Overview

In this lab, you create several VPC networks and VM instances and test connectivity across networks. Specifically, you create two custom mode networks (**managementnet** and **privatenet**) with firewall rules and VM instances as shown in this network diagram:
![network_diagram.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/PK9Q%2FN7%2Fg9mhg6%2BbLYn1KoKxPhDN7RqqiA6gtVTtXr4%3D)

The **mynetwork** network with its firewall rules and two VM instances (**mynet-eu-vm** and **mynet-us-vm**) have already been created for you in this Qwiklabs project.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Create custom mode VPC networks with firewall rules
- Create VM instances using Compute Engine
- Explore the connectivity for VM instances across VPC networks
- Create a VM instance with multiple network interfaces

## Setup and Requirements

#### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This Qwiklabs hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access the Google Cloud Platform for the duration of the lab.

#### What you need

To complete this lab, you need:

- Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
- Time to complete the lab.
  **_Note:_** If you already have your own personal GCP account or project, do not use it for this lab.

#### How to start your lab and sign in to the Console

1.  Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is a panel populated with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.
    ![Open Google Console](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/%2FtHp4GI5VSDyTtdqi3qDFtevuY014F88%2BFow%2FadnRgE%3D)
2.  Copy the username, and then click **Open Google Console**. The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the **Choose an account** page.
    **_Tip:_** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
3.  On the Choose an account page, click **Use Another Account**.
    ![Choose an account](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/eQ6xPnPn13GjiJP3RWlHWwiMjhooHxTNvzfg1AL2WPw%3D)
4.  The Sign in page opens. Paste the username that you copied from the Connection Details panel. Then copy and paste the password.
    **_Important:_** You must use the credentials from the Connection Details panel. Do not use your Qwiklabs credentials. If you have your own GCP account, do not use it for this lab (avoids incurring charges).
5.  Click through the subsequent pages:
    - Accept the terms and conditions.
    - Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
    - Do not sign up for free trials.

After a few moments, the GCP console opens in this tab.
**Note:** You can view the menu with a list of GCP Products and Services by clicking the **Navigation menu** at the top-left, next to “Google Cloud Platform”. ![Cloud Console Menu](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/9vT7xPlxoNP%2FPsK0J8j0ZPFB4HnnpaIJVCDByaBrSHg%3D)

### Activate Google Cloud Shell

Google Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Google Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your GCP resources.

1.  In GCP console, on the top right toolbar, click the Open Cloud Shell button.
    ![Cloud Shell icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/vdY5e%2Fan9ZGXw5a%2FZMb1agpXhRGozsOadHURcR8thAQ%3D)
2.  Click **Continue**. ![cloudshell_continue.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/lr3PBRjWIrJ%2BMQnE8kCkOnRQQVgJnWSg4UWk16f0s%2FA%3D)

It takes a few moments to provision and connect to the environment. When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your _PROJECT_ID_. For example:
![Cloud Shell Terminal](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/hmMK0W41Txk%2B20bQyuDP9g60vCdBajIS%2B52iI2f4bYk%3D)
**gcloud** is the command-line tool for Google Cloud Platform. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

You can list the active account name with this command:

```
gcloud auth list
```

Output:

```output
Credentialed accounts:
 - <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com (active)
```

Example output:

```Output
Credentialed accounts:
 - google1623327_student@qwiklabs.net
```

You can list the project ID with this command:

```
gcloud config list project
```

Output:

```output
[core]
project = <project_ID>
```

Example output:

```Output
[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-44776a13dea667a6
```

Full documentation of **gcloud** is available on [Google Cloud gcloud Overview](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

5.  Click on **Columns**, then select **Network**.
    There are three instances in **us-central1-c** and one instance in **europe-west1-c**. However, these instances are spread across three VPC networks (**managementnet**, **mynetwork** and **privatenet**), with no instance in the same zone and network as another. In the next section, you explore the effect this has on internal connectivity.

## Explore the connectivity between VM instances

Explore the connectivity between the VM instances. Specifically, determine the effect of having VM instances in the same zone versus having instances in the same VPC network.

### **Ping the external IP addresses**

Ping the external IP addresses of the VM instances to determine if you can reach the instances from the public internet.

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
2.  Note the external IP addressees for **mynet-eu-vm**, **managementnet-us-vm**, and **privatenet-us-vm**.
3.  For **mynet-us-vm**, click **SSH** to launch a terminal and connect.
4.  To test connectivity to **mynet-eu-vm**'s external IP, run the following command, replacing **mynet-eu-vm**'s external IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's external IP here>
```

This should work!

5.  To test connectivity to **managementnet-us-vm**'s external IP, run the following command, replacing **managementnet-us-vm**'s external IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter managementnet-us-vm's external IP here>
```

This should work!

6.  To test connectivity to **privatenet-us-vm**'s external IP, run the following command, replacing **privatenet-us-vm**'s external IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter privatenet-us-vm's external IP here>
```

This should work!

### **Ping the internal IP addresses**

Ping the internal IP addresses of the VM instances to determine if you can reach the instances from within a VPC network.

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
2.  Note the internal IP addressees for **mynet-eu-vm**, **managementnet-us-vm**, and **privatenet-us-vm**.
3.  Return to the **SSH** terminal for **mynet-us-vm**.
4.  To test connectivity to **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP, run the following command, replacing **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's internal IP here>
```

5.  To test connectivity to **managementnet-us-vm**'s internal IP, run the following command, replacing **managementnet-us-vm**'s internal IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter managementnet-us-vm's internal IP here>
```

6.  To test connectivity to **privatenet-us-vm**'s internal IP, run the following command, replacing **privatenet-us-vm**'s internal IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter privatenet-us-vm's internal IP here>
```

VPC networks are by default isolated private networking domains. However, no internal IP address communication is allowed between networks, unless you set up mechanisms such as VPC peering or VPN.

## Create a VM instance with multiple network interfaces

Every instance in a VPC network has a default network interface. You can create additional network interfaces attached to your VMs. Multiple network interfaces enable you to create configurations in which an instance connects directly to several VPC networks (up to 8 interfaces, depending on the instance's type).

### **Create the VM instance with multiple network interfaces**

Create the **vm-appliance** instance with network interfaces in **privatesubnet-us**, **managementsubnet-us** and **mynetwork**. The CIDR ranges of these subnets do not overlap, which is a requirement for creating a VM with multiple network interface controllers (NICs).

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
2.  Click **Create instance**.

### **Explore the network interface connectivity**

Demonstrate that the **vm-appliance** instance is connected to **privatesubnet-us**, **managementsubnet-us** and **mynetwork** by pinging VM instances on those subnets.

1.  In the Console, navigate to **Navigation menu** (![mainmenu.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/QRLlvUpflhvp875q7fi7Mf%2FiVCqtMcM10Vfn0vwKZ%2B4%3D)) > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
2.  Note the internal IP addressees for **privatenet-us-vm**, **managementnet-us-vm**, **mynet-us-vm**, and **mynet-eu-vm**.
3.  Return to the **SSH** terminal for **vm-appliance**.
4.  To test connectivity to **privatenet-us-vm**'s internal IP, run the following command, replacing **privatenet-us-vm**'s internal IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter privatenet-us-vm's internal IP here>
```

This works!

5.  Repeat the same test by running the following:

```
ping -c 3 privatenet-us-vm
```

6.  To test connectivity to **managementnet-us-vm**'s internal IP, run the following command, replacing **managementnet-us-vm**'s internal IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter managementnet-us-vm's internal IP here>
```

This works!

7.  To test connectivity to **mynet-us-vm**'s internal IP, run the following command, replacing **mynet-us-vm**'s internal IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-us-vm's internal IP here>
```

This works!

8.  To test connectivity to **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP, run the following command, replacing **mynet-eu-vm**'s internal IP:

```
ping -c 3 <Enter mynet-eu-vm's internal IP here>
```

9.  To list the routes for **vm-appliance** instance, run the following command:

```
ip route
```

The output should look like this (**do not copy; this is example output**):

```
default via 172.16.0.1 dev eth0
10.128.0.0/20 via 10.128.0.1 dev eth2
10.128.0.1 dev eth2 scope link
10.130.0.0/20 via 10.130.0.1 dev eth1
10.130.0.1 dev eth1 scope link
172.16.0.0/24 via 172.16.0.1 dev eth0
172.16.0.1 dev eth0 scope link
```

## Congratulations!

In this lab, you created several custom mode VPC networks, firewall rules and VM instances using the Console and the Cloud Shell command line. Then, you tested the connectivity across VPC networks which worked when pinging external IP addresses but not when pinging internal IP addresses. Thus, you created a VM instance with three network interfaces and verified internal connectivity for VM instances that are on the subnets that are attached to the multiple interface VM.

You also explored the default network along with its subnets, routes, and firewall rules. You deleted the default network and determined that you cannot create any VM instances without a VPC network. Thus, you created a new auto mode VPC network with subnets, routes, firewall rules and two VM instances. Then, you tested the connectivity for the VM instances and explored the effects of the firewall rules on connectivity.
