### VPC Networking Fundamentals

- **_A VPC network consists of subnets, routes and firewall rules_**
- **VPC Network CIDR can be as large as /9 and doesn't require CIDR to be defined**
- **Subnets** are regional, ie. spans across **Zones**, have a private RFC 1918 CIDR block of **/20** and a **gateway** which reserves **First IP address** of the CIDR block
- **Routes** tell VM instances and the VPC network how to send traffic from an instance to destination. Without a VPC network there are no routes.
- **Firewall** rules controls which packets are allowed to travel to which destinations
  - Firewall rules are applied based on **priority**. Higher integer corresponds to lower priority.
  - Each VPC network has 2 implied firewall rules: viz.
    1. **ingress deny all**. Priority 65535
    2. **egress allow all**. Priority 65535
  - Default ingress in default vpc
    1. **default-allow-{icmp,rdp,ssh}** from 0.0.0.0/0. Priority 65534
    2. **default-allow-internal** tcp, udp, icmp within VPC CIDR. Priority 65534
  - _RDP port 3389_
- **Default Internet Gateway** â‰¡ 0.0.0.0/0
- **External IP addresses** for instances are ephemeral and are released once a instance stops.
- **Static External IP Address** are reserve addresses assigned to a project until released explicitly.
- **SSH Connection** GCE generates SSH Key and stores it in:
  - By Default, add the generated key to project or instance metadata
  - If account is configured with **OS Login**, key is stored in user account
  - Alternatively, keys can be created and added to **public ssh key metadata** of an instance
- VPC network has internal DNS service. **An instance name can be used as internal DNS Name to access the instance other than internal IP address and external IP address**. `ping -c 3 mynet-eu-vm`
- Deleting a VPC network order
  1. Deletes firewall rules
  2. Deletes Routes
  3. Deletes Network
- Auto-mode network create subnets in each region automatically while custom starts with no subnets
- Access to instances with external ip addresses is only controlled by the ICMP firewall rules

### Multiple VPC Networks

- An instance can have **Multiple Network Interfaces (NIC)** based on instance type **(upto 8 NIC)** which enables connections to multiple VPC networks based on configuration
- VMs with multiple network interface controllers (NICs) **can't(?) be part of subnets with overlapping CIDR**
- **Internal DNS query** for instance hostname **resolves to the primary interface (nic0)** of the instance
- NICs get route to for the subnet it is in. In addition, the instance gets a single default route that is associated with the primary interface eth0.
- Unless manually configured otherwise, any traffic leaving an instance for any destination other than a directly connected subnet will leave the instance via the default route on eth0.

### VPC Networks - Controlling Access

- Instance Creation: Networks use network tags to identify which VM instances are subject to certain firewall rules and network routes. Later in this lab, you create a firewall rule to allow HTTP access for VM instances with the web-server tag. Alternatively, you could check the Allow HTTP traffic checkbox, which would tag this instance as http-server and create the tagged firewall rule for tcp:80 for you.
- VM get default service account [PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com.
  - 2 type of Service Accounts:
    1. User-managed service accounts
    2. Google-managed service accounts ([PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com) with Cloud IAM project editor role.
  - VM's Default Service Account doesn't have Network Admin Role and thus can't affect firewall and SSL certificates
- To activate a service account: Create a service account -> Assign role eg. Compute Security Admin -> Create Key -> Download json and rename to credentials.json -> `gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file credentials.json`

#### IAM

- Network Admin: Permissions to create, modify, and delete networking resources, except for firewall rules and SSL certificates. Provide listing of firewall resources
- Security Admin: Permissions to create, modify, and delete firewall rules and SSL certificates

### HTTP Load Balancer with Cloud Armor

- Use `siege` to stress test network load balancing
- GCP implements **HTTP(S) Loadbalancers** at edge location aka. point of presence **(POP)**
- **Cloud Armor provides IP whitelisting/blacklisting** to filter traffic to LBs.
- **Healthcheck probes** to loadbalanced instances comes from **130.211.0.0/22 and 35.191.0.0/16**
- **Managed Instance Groups** uses **Instance Templates** to create group of identical instances
- **Instance Groups** aws-aka. **AutoScaling Groups** use instance templates to to launch identical VMs based on load. They can be **created for a region or zone**
- **_startup-script-url_** awk-aka. **_user-data_**
- **_The Hostname and Server Location identifies where the HTTP Load Balancer sends traffic_**

## Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure

### Introduction

- **GCP**: Cloud based products and services = Infra + Platform + Software = Compute + Storage + Networking + BigData + Machine Learning = CSNBiM + G Suite + G Devices + Stackdriver, etc
- **Cloud Computing**: On-Demand + Broad Network Access + Resource Pooling + Elasticity + Measured Services (_Pay per use_)
- **History `<->` Future**: On Perm `->` Virtual `->` Serverless
- **Compute**: (Managed Infra) `<-` Compute Engine (_IaaS_) `-` Kubernetes Engine (_Hybrid_) `-` App Engine (_PaaS_) `-` Cloud Functions (_Serverless_) `-` Managed Services (_Automated Elastic Resource_) `->` (Dynamic Infra)
- Global -> Multi Region -> Region (_Each region separated by 160KM/100Miles_) -> Zones (_Think of them as separate facilities_)
- Environmental Concerns - 0 Carbon Emission and 100% Renewable Energy
- Encryption at Rest, In Transition, DDoS, Google Frontend Test for Vulnerabilities
- Built on **OpenAPIs** like kubernetes, Hadoop, Apache HBase which are opensource
- Encryption at Rest, In Transition, DDoS, Google Frontend Test for Vulnerabilities
- Project Number (_Auto-generated can't change_), Project ID _auto-generated, can be changed at time of creation only_, Project Name _user provided, NOT Globally unique_
- Project in gshell can be changed by `gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>`, current project is set in `$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID` `env` variable
  - `gcloud config list`
  - `gcloud config core list`

### Cloud Platform Hierarchy

- Compute Resources, IAM, least privilige, raw compute to managed services, access using web console/cli-tools(_G Cloud SDK preinstalled, gsutil, bq, gcloud_)/iOS/Android/APIs
- Resources are allocated based on **PROJECTS** which can be grouped under **FOLDERS**
- Organization Nodes -> Folders (_It is must to have org node to create folders_) -> Projects -> GCP Resources
  - Policies are inherited from top (eg. Org node), with more generous of them taking precedence (_consider it binary OR of access level_)
  - Org node can be create by using Cloud Identity
  - [?] _Billing is per project basis_

### IAM

- who (_person|group|application_) -> can do what (_previliges|actions_)-> on which resources (_GCP Services_)?
- Organization -= Folders -= Projects -= Members -= Roles -= Resources -= Products -= G Suit Super Admins
- Policy is set on resource comprises of **Roles and Role Members**
- Policies|Permission are **inherited top to down and is union of all policies** in the hierarchy with **less restrictive policy overriding restrictive policy**
- - _Follow principle of least privilege_

---

## Must Review

### Physical Infrastructure

Global System (_Internet_) `->` Points of Presence (_Edge Locations and CDNs_)
`->` Global (_Private Global Network_)
`->` Multi Region
`->` Region (_Each region separated by 160KM/100Miles_)
`->` Zones (_Think of them as separate facilities_)
`->` Datacenters
`->` Rack
`->` Physical Server
`->` vCPU (**2vCPU = 1 core**)

### Cloud Platform Hierarchy

- Organization Nodes `->` Folders (_It is must to have org node to create folders_) `->` Projects `->` GCP Resources
  - Policies are inherited from top (eg. Org node), with more generous of them taking precedence (_consider it binary OR of access level_)
  - Org node can be create by using Cloud Identity
  - Billing is per project basis
- Compute Resources, IAM, least privilege, raw compute to managed services, access using web console/cli-tools/iOS/Android/APIs
- Resources are allocated based on **PROJECTS** which can be grouped under **FOLDERS**

### Network Ingress and Egress

- **Normal Network**: Routes via internet to edge location _closets to destination_, available at _lower price_
- **Google**: Routes so traffic enters from @edge _closest to source_
  - Single global IP address and Loadbalancers worldwide
  - _AWS only supports Normal network_

### Pricing

- **Network Traffic**: Ingress Free, Egress charged per GB
  - _egress to a gcp service in a region is sometimes free_
- **Services**: Usage, Provisioned
- **Discounts**: Pay by second, Sustained Use discount, Customize compute resources or use out of box

### Security

- Separation of duties
- Encryption at rest, in transition even within gcp network, DDoS, Google Frontend Test for Vulnerabilities
- _Recommends: Distrust the network_
